player:
- test official submission
- in end-game, randomize guesses to avoid looping! (weigh by distance or something?)

arbiter:
- implement correct failure behaviour (if a player produces an illegal move, it 
  takes "T" turns from then on, to allow the opponent to finish the game)
- include debug output generated by judge comments?

MazeIO:
- MAYBE: fix output of side borders when printing in full view
