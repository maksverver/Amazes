- Is starting square initially discovered or not?
- What is the use of the Start line?
- What is the use of the orientation (except for complicating IO?)
- What is the purpose of the last discovery rule:
  "If the 25 walls of one outer edge of the maze have been discovered,
   the 25 walls on the opposing side are also determined as discovered."
  can this ever help your score?
- How are players placed initially? Are all valid pairings equally likely?
